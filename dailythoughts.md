The reason that I started this because the frustration that I was having with my lack of thesis progress. 
This is something that I definitely would have wanted to start sooner, but here we are. For a long time, I wasn't all that excited to
finish it. The feeling of actually finishing my degree seemed so far away, that I got discouraged and didn't even attempt to finish it. 
Overall, I have come closer than ever. This markdown file is going to have the result of me simply spewing my thoughts on what is going
on currently with my thesis.
