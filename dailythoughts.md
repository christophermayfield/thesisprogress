The reason that I started this because the frustration that I was having with my lack of thesis progress.
This is something that I definitely would have wanted to start sooner, but here we are. For a long time, I wasn't all that excited to
finish it. The feeling of actually finishing my degree seemed so far away, that I got discouraged and didn't even attempt to finish it.
Overall, I have come closer than ever. This markdown file is going to have the result of me simply spewing my thoughts on what is going
on currently with my thesis.

I worked a full day today. I Haven't been eating very well. I think that it is starting to catch up to me.
I also started fasting, which has been helping curb my eating. I also have been tracking my water and food intake.

I haven't been feeling well physically. I need to start eating better and taking my health more seriously.
I am considering maybe going to the doctor soon.
