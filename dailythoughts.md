The reason that I started this because the frustration that I was having with my lack of thesis progress.
This is something that I definitely would have wanted to start sooner, but here we are. For a long time, I wasn't all that excited to
finish it. The feeling of actually finishing my degree seemed so far away, that I got discouraged and didn't even attempt to finish it.
Overall, I have come closer than ever. This markdown file is going to have the result of me simply spewing my thoughts on what is going
on currently with my thesis.

I feel better right now. I fixed my issue with my teaching permit, so i'm able to teach again.

# October 3rd 2018
I accepted some jobs for next week, so that's good.

# October 9th 2018
I haven't been sleeping well, I'm going to get some simple work done at home and then hit it again tomorrow.

# October 27th 2018
I worked a full day today. I Haven't been eating very well. I think that it is starting to catch up to me.
I also started fasting, which has been helping curb my eating. I also have been tracking my water and food intake.

#October 28th, 2018
I haven't been feeling well physically. I need to start eating better and taking my health more seriously.
I am considering maybe going to the doctor soon.

#October 29th, 2018
I'm still not feeling the best. I woke up with a large headache and really sneezy.
I'm assuming that this is from allergies, but i'm going to follow up with a doctor.
I wrote some code for my thesis which is nice. Im going to work on some tomorrow.

Looking back at where I am in life. I realize that I need to figure out what is best for me.
I really am disappointed that I haven't been able to find meaningful work. I want to be able to find
work that gives me a large degree of meaning. I hope that I find this.

I have been coughing alot for months. My spirits are starting to get a little down. I think that I need to go to the doctor. I'm probably going to call to make an appointment. I really hope that nothing is wrong with my health.

Reading Sam Altman's blog on How To Be Successful. It's really enlightening. I'm here doing this right now at Sonora HS in La Habra. My main goal this is to be able to develop more self-belief in myself. I know that I am ordained to be able to do more in my life. I just need to harness that and believe more in myself. I am going to go to the gym tonight for a bit then go home and rest since I am not feeling all that great.

#February 22nd, 2019

I went through Sam Altman's blog on How To Be Successful again today. I was shocked how little I actually do in my life. Now, I want to change my work habits in order to be a more successful person.

I am feeling a bit better right now. I haven't gone to the doctor regarding the stuff that is going on in my health.

#February 25th, 2019

I don't know why, but I am having some onset anxiety. There is no reason to be. Maybe I just need to work on myself more. I'm going to try to add a calculus class today since I need that, but we will see what happens. I just heard that Karina is going to come over, so that is awesome. I didn't end up getting the calc class that I really wanted to in the end.

Nothing worked on today. I had a real crap show of a job today. Going to work on some work tomorrow. Starting not eating fast food for a little while. Let's see how this affects my health. Will check back soon.

#February 27th, 2019

Work was crazy today. I am going to rest tonight and try to get some work done today.

#February 28th, 2019

Not eating fast food has been rewarding. The last two days have consisted of just eating salads and whatever. I am subbing at Chino Adult School. I am going to try to get some work done. We will see what happens.
